hii there:)
I am a cybersecurity student who values protecting people and safeguarding systems and data. My strengths in leadership, communication, time management, and continuous learning support my passion for the defensive side of cybersecurity, where I am especially interested in emerging tools such as automation and AI. I am committed to helping organizations strengthen their security posture, reduce risks, and build trust, while continuing to refine my skills as I grow in the profession.
